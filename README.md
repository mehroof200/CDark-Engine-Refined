# CDark-Engine-Refined
A Game Engine That I Made (Still In development).

The **Window** Functions (Expect CloseWindow() and TerminateApplication()) Were all Referenced from Progrematic's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R5vSIZxr0M&t=4s&ab_channel=Progrematic

So Please give credit to him, because without his videos this wouldn't be possible!

And also I'm using A NuGet Package called 'nupengl.core' And Since It is Depracated, It might not Be The same As GLFW 3.3.8 But if you do face any problems please report it (Well There's no download website for this but when I release one, you should report it there. Thank you).
